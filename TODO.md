1. Add error handlign with alertdialogs everywhere (Including sending reports) (Make a reusable error handling widget and put it wherever there is DB operation, api calling or something like that)
2. Opening websites in the settings page for source code, author etc. (The github page for me, source code and a simple licenses page)
3. Adding multimedia options (using apis and custom screens)
4. Google Drive integration
5. Introduction Page (using the intro_page package)
6. Custom Icon (from the AppIcon.png in assets)
7. Splash Screen 
8. Source Code Refactoring (Add comments and add sensible kdebugmode print statements)
9. Add loading screens and buffering animations everywhere
