- This design.jpg doesn't actually mean anything right now, but was just a visualisation of the idea i had in my mind in the initial stages and helped build the initial UI layout. Now it doesn't need to be followed and most of the dialogs and new pages were built without it's guidance. It's just a part of the devlopmental history of this program.
- Fun Fact: (It was created in kolourpaint as i couldn't find a really easy to use and minimal alternative of paint on linux so i used it and it was too minimal, but it did help maing this design. Also, the placeholder images in assets folder were created using this. The icon was edited using it but was generated using AI.)
- I had used coolors.co for generating the color pallete for the primary scheme and the dark scheme i had generated using AI.
- The idea of this project was from my personal experience of journaling and using joplin and when i wanted to save stuff like images, location i visited, voice recording etc. it was really hard so i thought that doing this project i could learn dart and flutter.
- This code doesnt haave the contribution of anyone except me (at the time of writing this) and all the ideas and structures and designs are made by me.
